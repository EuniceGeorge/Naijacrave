# Introduction

## The Project
Naijacrave is a web-based food service that helps users discover and manage recipes tailored to their available ingredients. It allows users to search for recipes, create or share their own, and log in to access personalized features.
The service is designed to simplify meal planning by providing recipe suggestions based on what users have at home, promoting convenience and minimizing food waste.

## The Context
This project is our Portfolio Project, concluding our Foundations Year at Holberton School.
We were able to choose who we wanted to work with and what we wanted to work on, as long as we present a working program at the end of the three weeks of development.
